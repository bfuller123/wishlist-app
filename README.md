# Wishful Thinking

A CRUD app to help you manage your buyer's remorse. Once you have signed up for the service, you can start creating your wishlist of items, and in 30 days it will notify you that your item is ready to be purchased by moving it to your Ready to Buy list. Ready to buy or remove the item? Great! Just mark the item as such, and it will update accordingly, as well as update your tracked spendings/savings in the app.
